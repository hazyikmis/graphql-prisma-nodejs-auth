#endpoint: is the docker container running on our machine
#if we "prisma deploy", it always deploys to that endpoint
#we need to switch between development & production deployments to different endpoints
#(to make it short "endpoint" should be dynamic)
#We have created "/config" folder and created 2 config files for dev & prod separately
#AFTER ALL THESE CHANGES, WE NEED TO DEFINE WHICH env config FILE SHOULD BE USED WHEN DEPLOYING
#-->prisma deploy -e ../config/dev.env
#service: default
#stage: default
#the name of the schema creeated is: default$default
#(because we deleted "schema" key from docker-compose.yml)
